![[Shelter.png]]

An Underground bunker located away from the main house. This fallout shelter was designed specifically for air raids and features thick walls made from lead and other materials intended to block radiation. A computer terminal within has been connected to the house's network system should an emergency necessitate remote access.

**Type:** Blueprint, Dead End, Outer Room
**Rarity:** Unusual

Any random spawns?
- None
## Terminal
Name of terminal: Mt. Holly Bomb Shelter

Initial options:
- 1) Time-Lock Safe
- 2) Radiation Monitor
- 3) Login to Network
- 4) Exit
##### 1) Time-Lock Safe:
![[TimelockSafeMenu.jpg]]
This menu option allows you to configure the [[#Time-lock Safe]] (see below) by setting the date and time you want it to unlock.

##### 2) Radiation Monitor
![[RadMonitorMenu.jpg]]
This menu option allows you to scan for the radiation levels in and surrounding the house and its grounds. If the reading is or above 12 uSv then the emergency protocol will initiate and all the doors in the house will automatically lock.

Base reading is around 0.10uSv, using the laboratory can increase this.

##### 3) Log into Network
This is the exact same as all the other terminals.
## Time-lock Safe
Set the unlock time + date from the terminal inside the shelter next to the safe. The demo starts on November 7th, add on days for what day your currently on. Time can be seen on the large clock at the front of the main building. Unlock condition needs to be set at least 1h into the future and the safe will stay open for 4 hours after unlocking.

Inside: 1 gem, red letter 3.
##### Red letter 3 (white paper, typed):
Page 1:
> Dear uncle, 
> The disappearance of my cousin Mary has long sat unfavourably with me and my father. And I will freely admit to you that the chilly airs of indifference you may have felt in my presence can be attributed entirely to the suspicions that I have harbored for these past years. Suspicions entirely aimed at yourself.
>
> And while I have never had the opportunity to prove it, I felt very strongly that you had some deeper involvement in those events 6 years ago. The circulating rumors of those months did nothing but further reinforce my convictions in this fact.
>
> Those of us that are once bitten are twice shy and I am aware of the cost my aggressively aloof behavior has had on the social standing of our family. I do not apologise for my actions, though I am now willing to admit that the conclusions I reached may have been flawed.

Page 2:
> Last week, I had a confidential conversation with one of our mutual acquaintances. A conversation that has shed more light on this mystery than all of my father's countless fruitless inquiries over the years.
>
> I now have reason to believe that you were in fact responsible for smuggling my cousin under cover of night across the red border to the southern seafront. And I believe this may have occurred in September, a full 7 months after she was reported missing. A date that coincides not with her public "disappearance" in Febuary but instead with the notable theft of the Ruby Crown.
>
> If the Black Water insurgents were in face responsible for the heist as some have claimed, I believe this scenario entirely plausible. And the fact that 2 of the crown's eight rubies have now surfaced has given me renewed optimism that she is still alive.
>
> Alive, safe and finally free.

Page 3: 
> Perhaps, my willingness to accept such a sensational story betrays my own desperation.
>
> Desperation for answers. Desperation for hope. And desperation for a narrative in which you are not the villain.
> 
> In that distant land we all dream of, the land where the strangling crimson curtains draped across our sky are pulled back, and the windows and shutters of discontent flung wide open. In that distant land, I pray one day to find our Marion safe, happy and absolved.
>
> 																- Courtney
## Note on the shelf at the back (white paper, typed):
> Remain where you are for now. Given that the Red Guard is due tomorrow, we've agreed with your plan and have disabled remote access to the other terminals and have sealed the network mainframe.
> 
> Regardless of the danger, I am still not willing to risk removing SHELTER from the draft pool while the three of you are down there. Our best bet is to sit tight and hope for a little bit of luck.
